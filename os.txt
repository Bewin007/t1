Creating a data analysis based on a sample population can become complicated if you are basing the frequency on exact numerical values that are continuous such as GPA, distance, weight and height.  Creating a categorical analysis based on identical data, would display numerous bars within the charts and make the analysis nearly impossible.  In a position where you have sampled a population that provides a wide range of variables to analyze, it would be more beneficial for the results to be analyzed in specified ranges to provide a more concise frequency.  In this instance, is it is best to create a frequency distribution table where data can be put into numerical ranges instead of individual frequency’s.

As all ranges are continuous from each other, you can chart your data using a histogram.  A histogram shows that the data within the frequency distribution overlaps and one range picks up where another left off so there are no breaks in between the individual bars that visually display the range of the frequencies in the chart.

A frequency distribution was conducted that showed the GPA’s of current MBA Students.  The GPA’s associated with these students was listed on the frequency distribution spreadsheet based on the observed data that was detailed on the student data file. Based on the wide array of possible variables for analysis, the student’s GPA’s were arranged within assigned ranges.  The ranges 2.50-2.75, 2.75-3.00, 3.00-3.25, 3.25-3.50, 3.50-3.75 and 3.75-4.00 will still allow us to analyze all the data concerning the 200 MBA students, but within groups instead of individually.
